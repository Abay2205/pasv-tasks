/* 
he football team took part in several games of the football season.

The array stores information about the number of goals scored by each player in different games.

For example, [[1, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 4], ..., [2, 1, 1]].

If a football player has not scored a single goal, then there is no information about his goals in the array. Those. there is no element [0] in the array. 
It is required to determine the total number of goals scored by a football team in a season.

Write a function sumOfGoals that takes an array arr that stores the number of goals scored by each player in different games
and returns the total number of goals scored by a football team.

Use a loop in your solution. Array methods are not allowed.
*/

function sumOfGoals(arr){
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){ 
    for(let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++){
      sum = sum + arr[i][j];
    }
  }
  return sum;    
}
