/* 
The array stores information about cars in the dealership and their prices. Data about each car is presented as an array [made, price] (for example, ["Mazda", 17000]).
Get the name of the most expensive car. If there are several cars with the same price in the array, return the first one.

Write the mostExpensiveCar function that takes an array arr containing the car data and returns the name of the most expensive car.
In all tests, the input array is not empty.

Use a loop in your solution. The use of the Math.max () method is not permitted.

Example:

mostExpensiveCar ([["Honda", 18500], ["Toyota", 21200], ["BMW", 19900]]) should return "Toyota";
mostExpensiveCar ([["Honda", 18000], ["Toyota", 18000]]) should return "Honda";
mostExpensiveCar ([["BMW", 19900]]) should return "BMW".
*/

function mostExpensiveCar(arr){
  let arr1 = [];
  let b;
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    arr1.push(arr[i][1]);
  }
  let max = arr1[0];
  for(let j = 1; j < arr1.length; j++){
    if(max < arr1[j]) max = arr1[j];
  }
  for(let a = 0; a < arr.length; a++){
    if(arr[a][1] === max) b = arr[a][0];
  }
  return b;
